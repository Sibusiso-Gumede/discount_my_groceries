# Discount My Groceries
An application that enables shoppers to find the cheapest price of a product accross multiple supermarkets.

The current implementation is a web app developed using Django, Bootstrap, HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript.
It consists of four main functionalities that can be found on the top navigation panel:
- ### Home: the main page where a user can enter the name of a product and get routed to the results page.
