# Discount My Groceries
An application that enables shoppers to find the cheapest price of a product accross multiple supermarkets.

The current implementation is a web app developed using Django, Bootstrap, HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript.
It consists of four main functionalities that can be found on the top navigation panel:
1. Home - the main page where a user can enter the name of a product and get routed to the results page.
2. Receiptify - a user can type product names, add them to the list, and get image files or a pdf of the grocery receipt.
3. Near Me - the user can easily find nearby supermarkets based on their current location.
4. Supermarkets - data visualisation of brick and mortar statistics.
